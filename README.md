## Determinant Calculation Algorithms Performance Evaluation and Histogram Visualization C C++ Python
A small college project, in which I'm benchmarking the performance of different method's, algorythms and libraries for calculating a determinant of a NxN matrix. 
### Brief description of files
**jezykc.c** - testing two algorythms and **gsl** library,

**python.py** - testing the same two algorythmsd and **numpy** library,

**jezykcpp.cpp** - testing the same two algorythms and **Eigen** library, also generates histogram of determinans using the ""gnuplot"" lib. Additionaly can print all of the matricies into a text file.
