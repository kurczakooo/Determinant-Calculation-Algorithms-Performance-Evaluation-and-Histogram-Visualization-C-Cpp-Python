## Determinant Calculation Algorithms Performance Evaluation and Histogram Visualization C C++ Python
A small college project, in which I'm benchmarking the performance of different methods, algorithms, and libraries for calculating a determinant of an NxN matrix. 
### Brief description of files
**jezykc.c** - testing two algorithms and **gsl** library,

**python.py** - testing the same two algorithms and **numpy** library,

**jezykcpp.cpp** - testing the same two algorithms and **Eigen** library, also generates a histogram of determinans using the ""gnuplot"" lib. Additionally can print all of the matrices into a text file.
